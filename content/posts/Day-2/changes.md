## Same as Title

I changed the theme of the site. I am wondering if anyone would be interested in visiting this site. Much better things to do ig. I tried adding comments to artices but failed. These previous 3 days i have spent too much time in this site, maybe i should doing other things. I was trying to Learn Qt to help me contribute to KDE. Maybe i should start again. Also since i am in a society (CP Domain) in my college, i should start doing leetcode. Codechef was simple just #include, int main()... but in this there's class and something written i don't understand this. Have to spend some time in this. Hope i find exciting things to work on and if time is with me that i find all. Thanks for listening (if someone did).
