[{"content":" Same as Title # I changed the theme of the site. I am wondering if anyone would be interested in visiting this site. Much better things to do ig. I tried adding comments to artices but failed. These previous 3 days i have spent too much time in this site, maybe i should doing other things. I was trying to Learn Qt to help me contribute to KDE. Maybe i should start again. Also since i am in a society (CP Domain) in my college, i should start doing leetcode. Codechef was simple just #include, int main()\u0026hellip; but in this there\u0026rsquo;s class and something written i don\u0026rsquo;t understand this. Have to spend some time in this. Hope i find exciting things to work on and if time is with me that i find all. Thanks for listening (if someone did).\n","date":"20 fevereiro 2026","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/day-2/changes/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Changes","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"20 fevereiro 2026","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Posts","type":"posts"},{"content":" About Me # Wherever i go they want an intro. Well, hello! My name is Suryansh. You must have guessed it by the site name. I am not pro at anything but just finding where i can find the spark. I like trying everything (anything which requires a laptop or mobile), i am not a very talkative person. I get very shy. But since even if you judge me by my writing, i dont mind. My current interests are or what i am doing right now is to create this site , make it more beautiful (i hope it does), trying to do leetcode. I actually tried to do some CP problems get my rating up but i don\u0026rsquo;t think i am good at this. I like maths but thinking how to solve the problems seemed exhausting. I think maybe some people are gifted , consistency matters too, I am currently in a college (1st year currently), can\u0026rsquo;t say i am enjoying . Nevertheless i am starting to do leetcode more as coding is required thing i hope it\u0026rsquo;s easier than codeforces. Placements too are based on your leetcode rank/score, idk. Wish me Luck!\nThanks for listening to me.\n","date":"18 fevereiro 2026","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/intro/my-first-post/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Intro","type":"posts"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/about-me/","section":"About-Mes","summary":"","title":"About-Mes","type":"about-me"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/pt-br/authors/","section":"Authors","summary":"","title":"Authors","type":"authors"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/pt-br/","section":"Blowfish","summary":"","title":"Blowfish","type":"page"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/pt-br/categories/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Categories","type":"categories"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/pt-br/series/","section":"Series","summary":"","title":"Series","type":"series"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/pt-br/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags","type":"tags"}]
