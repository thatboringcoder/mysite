    <meta name="description" content="About Me
Wherever i go they want an intro. Well, hello! My name is Suryansh. You must have guessed it by the site name. I am not pro at anything but just finding where i can find the spark. I like trying everything (anything which requires a laptop or mobile), i am not a very talkative person. I get very shy. But since even if you judge me by my writing, i dont mind. My current interests are or what i am doing right now is to create this site , make it more beautiful (i hope it does), trying to do leetcode. I actually tried to do some CP problems get my rating up but i don&rsquo;t think i am good at this. I like maths but thinking how to solve the problems seemed exhausting. I think maybe some people are gifted , consistency matters too, I am currently in a college (1st year currently), can&rsquo;t say i am enjoying . Nevertheless i am starting to do leetcode more as coding is required thing i hope it&rsquo;s easier than codeforces. Placements too are based on your leetcode rank/score, idk. Wish me Luck!">
